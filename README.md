# Lecture Note

This repository serves as a structured project using **React** with **Vite**, designed to facilitate efficient development and integration of modern web technologies. It showcases practical implementations of React concepts and various functionalities for learning and reference.

## Features

- **React and Vite Integration**: Built with Vite to ensure a fast development environment and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for seamless updates during development.
- **Custom React Hooks**: Demonstrates the use of custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and improve code modularity.
- **Axios Library**: 
  - Utilized for HTTP requests with methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`.
  - Includes configuration of Axios interceptors to manage requests and responses effectively.

## Key Dependencies

- **React Plugins**:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes Babel for efficient development with React.
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): An alternative plugin leveraging SWC for faster performance.
- **Axios**: A popular HTTP client library for making API calls and handling complex request flows.

## Learning Highlights

This repository is an ideal reference for understanding:

1. Setting up a React project with Vite for high performance.
2. Using **custom hooks** to improve code reusability and readability.
3. Fetching and managing data with **Axios**, including advanced features like interceptors for request/response handling.

## Usage

Clone this repository to explore the setup and experiment with the implementation of React and Axios. It's a compact yet versatile starting point for web development projects that require clean, efficient, and modern tooling.
